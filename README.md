# Shortest-Way-Out

The Shortest Way Out is a program that allows the user to find the shortest distance between any two nodes in a connected graph. In order to use this program, the user needs to plot down nodes on a blank surface and connect them with edges, and the length of the edges will be calculated by the program. When the user has finished building the graph, they will need to input the indices of the two nodes in the graph for finding the shortest distance and the program will find the shortest distance between those nodes.

## Instructions 

First, you should click the "Plot Node" button to toggle plotting mode; then, you can plot a node at your cursor's current position when you left click your mouse.

Next, there are three ways to connect your nodes with edges. The first way is to manually input the index of the starting node and the ending node. If you want to input multiple edges, then modify the input file and read from file is a more efficient way to connect your nodes. Or if you don't want to manually input any edges, you can randomize the edges by using the "Randomize Edges" button.

After you finish all of that, you can pick any two nodes and find out the shortest path between them by using the "Run Djikstra" button. You can change the colour of the shortest path by using the dropdown list, and "Clear Path" when you want to find the shortest path for other nodes.
